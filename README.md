# pong-game
an GUI project that replicates the classic pong game. The game is designed for two players (left paddle and right paddle) that are controlled using the up/down arrows and the W and S keys, respectively. The ball mechanics was designed to bounce when it hits the top and bottom of the screen (Y axis) and when it hits the paddles. If the ball moves throught the left or right of the screen, a point is awarded to the player of the opposite direction.

The game difficulty is incrementally increased (ball movement speed) for each bounce off the paddles until a point is awarded, where the said movement speed is resetted.
